# Guidelines for Contributors

Greetings, fellow human! We are glad that you appreciate the things that we, as
humans, enjoy doing. This planet holds many wonders to be experienced,
including:

* Snacks which are harmful to most non-humans, such as chocolate
* Static, single-page websites with minimal or no interactivity
* Laundry machines which consistently consume one of the four socks that our
  human feet require

But you're probably here about that website.

This project is an experiment, unleashed all at once onto an unsuspecting
planet… with minimal concern for the consequences. Like all experiments, it is
destined for obscurity and obsolescence. If you value this experiment, help keep
it alive for awhile longer.

The human maintainer—yes, at the moment, only one—has many such experiments to
conduct. The maintainer also hopes to discover the whereabouts of that missing
sock. You can help the maintainer out by reducing the burden of maintainership
as much as possible. Specifically, we request that your contributions have a
high SIGNAL-TO-NOISE ratio.

## Contributions Sought

In general, contributions are *not solicited* for this project. Bugs and/or pull
requests may be closed without much comment. We accept bug reports and pull
requests to:

* Fix rendering issues… but only with browsers which are reasonably
  standards-compliant and were released "recently."

* Change the wording. If you think your wording is more clever or humorous than
  the existing language, go ahead and submit it… but it will probably be
  rejected.

* Security concerns may be submitted via public bug report.

## Forking

Feel free to take this design and use it for your own site. The 3-clause BSD
[license](./LICENSE.md) grants you this right!
